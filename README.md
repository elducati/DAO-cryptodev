# DAO 

You can think of DAOs as analogous to companies in the real world. Essentially, DAOs allow for members to create and vote on governance decisions. 
This is a DAO for the Cryptodev.

# Building DAO

You want to launch a DAO for holders of your CryptoDevs NFTs. From the ETH that was gained through the ICO, you built up a DAO Treasury. The DAO now has a lot of ETH, but currently does nothing with it.
You want to allow your NFT holders to create and vote on proposals to use that ETH for purchasing other NFTs from an NFT marketplace, and speculate on price. Maybe in the future when you sell the NFT back, you split the profits among all members of the DAO.

# Requirements

Anyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace

Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals

Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal

Voter cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT

If majority of the voters vote for the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatically executed
